            "content":"Since triangle ABC is isosceles, we know that AC = BC. Therefore, we can set the expressions for AC and BC equal to each other and solve for x:\n\n4x + 1 = 5x - 0.5\n\nSubtracting 4x from both sides, we get:\n\n1 = x - 0.5\n\nAdding 0.5 to both sides, we get:\n\n1.5 = x\n\nNow that we know the value of x, we can substitute it back into the expression for AC to find its length:\n\nAC = 4x + 1\n\nAC = 4(1.5) + 1\n\nAC = 6 + 1\n\nAC = 7\n\nTherefore, the length of AC is 7."
