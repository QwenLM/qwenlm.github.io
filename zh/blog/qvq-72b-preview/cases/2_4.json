Ruka's birthday is on June 24.\n2. Yuki's birthday is on September 17.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **From June 24 to June 30:**\n   - June 24 to June 30 is 6 days.\n\n2. **From July 1 to August 31:**\n   - July has 31 days.\n   - August has 31 days.\n   - Total days in July and August: 31 + 31 = 62 days.\n\n3. **From September 1 to September 17:**\n   - September 1 to September 17 is 17 days.\n\nNow, we add all these days together:\n\n- June 24 to June 30: 6 days\n- July 1 to August 31: 62 days\n- September 1 to September 17: 17 days\n\nTotal days = 6 + 62 + 17 = 85 days\n\nTherefore, there are 85 days between Ruka's and Yuki's birthdays."
