## Model Capabilities

### 1. Enhanced Recognition Capabilities

Qwen2-VL now boasts improved object recognition, extending beyond plants and landmarks to comprehend complex relationships between multiple objects in a scene. We've also significantly boosted the model's ability to recognize handwritten text and multiple languages within images, making it more accessible to users worldwide.

{{< example data="cases/1_5.json" hide=true next=true >}}
{{< /fullwidth >}}

### 2. Visual Reasoning: Solving Real-World Problems

In this iteration, we have significantly enhanced Qwen2-VL's mathematical and coding proficiencies. The model is not only capable of solving problems by analyzing pictures but can also interpret and solve complex mathematical problems through chart analysis. Extremely aspect-ratio-distorted images can also be correctly interpreted.  Additionally, we have reinforced the model's capability to extract information from real-world images and charts and improved its instruction-following skills. This fusion of visual perception and logical reasoning empowers the model to tackle practical issues, bridging the gap between abstract concepts and tangible solutions.

{{< example data="cases/2_6.json" hide=true next=true >}}
{{< example data="cases/2_7.json" hide=true next=true >}}
{{< /fullwidth >}}

### 3. Video Understanding and Live Chat

Beyond static images, Qwen2-VL extends its prowess to video content analysis. It can summarize video content, answer questions related to it, and maintain a continuous flow of conversation in real-time, offering live chat support. This functionality allows it to act as a personal assistant, helping users by providing insights and information drawn directly from video content.

{{< example data="cases/3_4.json" hide=true next=true >}}
{{< /fullwidth >}}

### 4. Visual Agent Capabilities: Function Calling and Visual Interactions.

Qwen2-VL demonstrates strong potential as a visual agent, facilitating interactions similar to human perceptions of the world. 

- The model facilitates Function Calling, enabling it to harness external tools for real-time data retrieval – be it flight statuses, weather forecasts, or package tracking – by deciphering visual cues. This integration of visual interpretation with functional execution elevates its utility, making it a powerful tool for information management and decision-making.

{{< fullwidth class="example-container" >}}
{{< example data="cases/4_1.json" hide=false next=true >}}
{{< example data="cases/4_2.json" hide=true next=true >}}
{{< example data="cases/4_7.json" hide=true next=true >}}
{{< example data="cases/4_8.json" hide=true next=true >}}
{{< /fullwidth >}}

* Visual Interactions represent a significant stride towards mimicking human perception. By allowing the model to engage with visual stimuli akin to human senses, we're pushing the boundaries of AI's ability to perceive and respond to its environment. This capability paves the way for more intuitive and immersive interactions, where Qwen2-VL acts not just as an observer, but an active participant in our visual experiences.

{{< fullwidth class="example-container" >}}
{{< example data="cases/4_3.json" hide=false next=true >}}
{{< example data="cases/4_4.json" hide=true next=true >}}
{{< example data="cases/4_5.json" hide=true next=true >}}
{{< example data="cases/4_6.json" hide=true next=true >}}
{{< /fullwidth >}}

Certainly, the model is not perfect and has some limitations that I hope you can understand. For example, the model is unable to extract audio from videos, and its knowledge is only up to date as of June 2023. Additionally, the model cannot guarantee complete accuracy when processing complex instructions or scenarios, and it is relatively weak in tasks involving counting, character recognition, and 3D spatial awareness.

## Model Architecture

Overall, we've continued with the Qwen-VL architecture, which leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) model and Qwen2 language models. For all these variants, we utilized a ViT with approximately 600M parameters, designed to handle both image and video inputs seamlessly. To further enhance the model's ability to effectively perceive and comprehend visual information in videos, we introduced several key upgrades:

* A key architectural improvement in Qwen2-VL is the implementation of **Naive Dynamic Resolution support**. Unlike its predecessor, Qwen2-VL can handle arbitrary image resolutions, mapping them into a dynamic number of visual tokens, thereby ensuring consistency between the model input and the inherent information in images. This approach more closely mimics human visual perception, allowing the model to process images of any clarity or size. 

{{< figure src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-VL/qwen2_vl.jpg#center" width="90%">}}


* Another key architectural enhancement is the innovation of **Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-ROPE)**. By deconstructing the original rotary embedding into three parts representing temporal and spatial (height and width) information，M-ROPE enables LLM to concurrently capture and integrate 1D textual, 2D visual, and 3D video positional information.

## Developing with Qwen2-VL

To use the largest Qwen2-VL model, Qwen2-VL-72B, you can access it through our official API (sign up the account and obtain the API key through [DashScope](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/)) temporarily as demonstrated below:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os
import base64


def encode_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")


# Path to your image
image_path = "dog_and_girl.jpeg"

# Getting the base64 string
base64_image = encode_image(image_path)


def get_response():
    client = OpenAI(
        api_key=os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
        base_url="https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1",
    )
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="qwen-vl-max-0809",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {"type": "text", "text": "What is this?"},
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": {
                            "url": "https://dashscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/dog_and_girl.jpeg"
                        },
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}"},
                    },
                ],
            }
        ],
        top_p=0.8,
        stream=True,
        stream_options={"include_usage": True},
    )
    for chunk in completion:
        print(chunk.model_dump_json())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_response()
```

The 2B and 7B models of the Qwen2-VL series are open-sourced and accessible on Hugging Face and ModelScope. You can explore the model cards for detailed usage instructions, features, and performance metrics. Below we provide an example of the simplest usage with HF Transformers.

Make sure you install `transformers` from source by `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers` as codes for Qwen2-VL were just merged into the main branch. If you didn't install it from source, you may encounter the following error:

```bash
KeyError: 'qwen2_vl'
```

We offer a toolkit to help you handle various types of visual input more conveniently. It supports inputs including base64, URLs, and interleaved images and videos. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install qwen-vl-utils
```

Here is a code snippet for demonstration. Specifically, we recommend using flash attention 2 if possible for the sake of acceleration and memory saving. 

```python
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer, AutoProcessor
from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info

# default: Load the model on the available device(s)
model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", device_map="auto"
)

# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving, especially in multi-image and video scenarios.
# model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
#     "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct",
#     torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
#     attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
#     device_map="auto",
# )

# default processer
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct")

# The default range for the number of visual tokens per image in the model is 4-16384. You can set min_pixels and max_pixels according to your needs, such as a token count range of 256-1280, to balance speed and memory usage.
# min_pixels = 256*28*28
# max_pixels = 1280*28*28
# processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "image": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-VL/assets/demo.jpeg",
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},
        ],
    }
]

# Preparation for inference
text = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True
)
image_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(messages)
inputs = processor(
    text=[text],
    images=image_inputs,
    videos=video_inputs,
    padding=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)

# Inference: Generation of the output
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
generated_ids_trimmed = [
    out_ids[len(in_ids) :] for in_ids, out_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]
output_text = processor.batch_decode(
    generated_ids_trimmed, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False
)
print(output_text)
```

To facilitate seamless integration and use of our latest models, we support a range of tools and frameworks in the open-source ecosystem, including quantization ([AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/AutoGPTQ/AutoGPTQ), [AutoAWQ](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ)), deployment ([vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)), finetuning ([Llama-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory)), etc.
