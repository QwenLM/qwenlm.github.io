# Introduction

In this blog, we delve into the details of our latest Qwen2.5 series language models. We have developed a range of decoder-only dense models, with seven of them open-sourced, spanning from 0.5B to 72B parameters. Our research indicates a significant interest among users in models within the 10-30B range for production use, as well as 3B models for mobile applications. To meet these demands, we are open-sourcing Qwen2.5-3B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Qwen2.5-32B. Furthermore, we are excited to offer additional models, including Qwen-Plus and Qwen-Turbo, available through API services via [Alibaba Cloud Model Studio](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/developer-reference/what-is-qwen-llm).

Compared with the Qwen2 series, the Qwen2.5 series has the following upgrades:

1) **Full-scale Open-source**: Considering that users have a strong interest in models in the 10-30B range for production and 3B models for mobile applications, Qwen2.5, in addition to continuing to open source the four models of 0.5/1.5/7/72B of the same size as Qwen2, also added two medium-sized cost-effective models of **Qwen2.5-14B** and **Qwen2.5-32B** and a mobile-side model called **Qwen2.5-3B**. 
All models are highly competitive compared to open-source models of the same level. For example, Qwen2.5-32B beats Qwen2-72B and Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Qwen2-57B-A14B in our comprehensive evaluations.

2) **Larger and Higher Quality Pre-training Dataset**: The size of the pre-training dataset is expanded from 7 trillion tokens to a maximum of **18 trillion** tokens. 

3) **Knowledge Enhancement**: Qwen2.5 has acquired significantly more knowledge. On MMLU benchmarks, Qwen2.5-7/72B are improved from 70.3 to **74.2** and 84.2 to **86.1** compared to Qwen2-7/72B. We observe that Qwen2.5 also has significant improvements on the GPQA/MMLU-Pro/MMLU-redux/ARC-c benchmarks.

4) **Coding Enhancement**: Thanks to the technical breakthrough of Qwen2.5-Coder, Qwen2.5 has greatly improved capabilities in coding. Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct achieves **55.5**, **75.1**, and **88.2** scores on LiveCodeBench (2305-2409), MultiPL-E and MBPP, respectively, outperforming Qwen2-72B-Instruct with 32.2, 69.2, and 80.2.

5) **Math Enhancement**: After integrating Qwen2-math's technology, the mathematical ability of Qwen2.5 has also been rapidly improved. On the MATH benchmark, the scores of Qwen2.5-7B/72B-Instruct have been increased from 52.9/69.0 of Qwen2-7B/72B-Instruct to **75.5/83.1**.

6) **Better Human Preference**: Qwen2.5 is capable of generating responses that align more closely with human preferences. Specifically, the Arena-Hard score for Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct has increased significantly from **48.1** to **81.2**, and the MT-Bench score has improved from **9.12** to **9.35**, compared to Qwen2-72B-Instruct.

7) **Other Core Capabilities Enhancement**: Qwen2.5 achieves significant improvements in **instruction following**, **generating long texts** (increased from 1k to over **8K tokens**), **understanding structured data** (e.g., tables), and **generating structured outputs**, especially JSON. Furthermore, Qwen2.5 models are generally more resilient to the diversity of **system prompts**, enhancing **role-play** implementation and **condition-setting** for chatbots.


# Model Card

Here is a model card detailing the key parameters of the Qwen2.5 LLM models. This release includes seven open-sourced models with sizes ranging from 0.5B to 72B. Most models support a context length of 128K (131,072) tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens, enabling the production of extensive text outputs. The majority of these models are licensed under Apache 2.0, while Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-72B are governed by the Qwen Research License and Qwen License, respectively.

### Performances on Multilingualism

To evaluate the multilingual performance of instruction-tuned models, we collect and extend benchmarks as follows:
- **IFEval (multilingual)**: We translate the examples from IFEval (English version) to construct multilingual IFEval examples after removing examples with language-specific contents (e.g., "start with letter A"). We collect 100 examples for each language among Arabic (ar), Spanish (es), French (fr), Indonesian (in), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Portuguese (pt), and Vietnamese (vi) languages. All examples are checked and post-edited (if neccessary) by paid volunteers.
- **Knowledge**: We use 5 MMLU-like benchmarks (multi-choice) to testify the knowledge utilization ability of Qwen2.5 series models on multilingualism, including AMMLU (Arabic), JMMLU (Japanese), KMMLU (Korean), IndoMMLU (Indonesian), and TurkishMMLU (Turkish). Also, we present the performances on translated MMLU (i.e., okapi_MMLU, from English to multiple languages).
- **MGSM8K (extended)**: Aside from the examples in the original MGSM8K benchmark, we extend the language support with Arabic (ar), Korean (ko), Portuguese (pt), and Vietnamese (vi). We translate 250 examples (same as the other languages engaged in MGSM8K) into those 4 languages. All examples are also checked and post-edited (if necessary) by paid volunteers.
- **Cultural Nuances**: We also use BLEnD, a benchmark aiming at testifying cultural nuances of LLMs, to testify LLMs from the Qwen2.5 series.
