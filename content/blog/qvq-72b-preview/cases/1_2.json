            "content": "So I've got this graph here with three semicircles, each labeled with an equation: $2x - x^2$, $-12 + 8x - x^2$, and $-72 + 18x - x^2$. They're shaded and placed along the x-axis from 0 to 12, with y-values going up to 5. The task is to evaluate the integral of these functions using the formula for circles.\n\nFirst, I need to recognize that each of these equations represents a semicircle. The general equation for a circle is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius. Since these are semicircles above the x-axis, I can assume that the full circle equations can be found by rearranging these given equations.\n\nLet's start with the first one: $2x - x^2$. I need to rewrite this in the standard circle equation form. Let's move all terms to one side:\n\n$x^2 - 2x + y^2 = 0$\n\nTo complete the square for the x-terms:\n\nTake $x^2 - 2x$, half of -2 is -1, so $(x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1$. So,\n\n$(x - 1)^2 - 1 + y^2 = 0$\n\nThen,\n\n$(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1$\n\nThis is a circle with center $(1, 0)$ and radius 1.\n\nNext, the second equation: $-12 + 8x - x^2$. Again, rearrange:\n\n$x^2 - 8x + y^2 = -12$\n\nComplete the square for x:\n\nHalf of -8 is -4, so $(x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16$. So,\n\n$(x - 4)^2 - 16 + y^2 = -12$\n\n$(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 4$\n\nThus, a circle with center $(4, 0)$ and radius 2.\n\nThird equation: $-72 + 18x - x^2$. Rearrange:\n\n$x^2 - 18x + y^2 = -72$\n\nComplete the square for x:\n\nHalf of -18 is -9, so $(x - 9)^2 = x^2 - 18x + 81$. So,\n\n$(x - 9)^2 - 81 + y^2 = -72$\n\n$(x - 9)^2 + y^2 = 9$\n\nThis is a circle with center $(9, 0)$ and radius 3.\n\nNow, since all these are semicircles above the x-axis, their equations are actually $y = \\sqrt{r^2 - (x - h)^2}$, where $r$ is the radius and $(h, k)$ is the center.\n\nSo, the integrals I need to evaluate are the areas under these semicircles from their left endpoints to their right endpoints.\n\nThe area of a semicircle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi r^2$, but since they're only above the x-axis, it's already a semicircle, so the integral should give me exactly that area.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the integral of $y$ with respect to x over the interval where each semicircle exists.\n\nLet's consider the first semicircle: center at x=1, radius 1.\n\nIts left endpoint is at x=0 and right endpoint at x=2.\n\nThe equation is $y = \\sqrt{1^2 - (x - 1)^2}$.\n\nSo, the integral from 0 to 2 of $y$ dx should be $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSimilarly, the second semicircle: center at x=4, radius 2.\n\nLeft endpoint at x=2, right endpoint at x=6.\n\nEquation: $y = \\sqrt{2^2 - (x - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{4 - (x - 4)^2}$.\n\nIntegral from 2 to 6 of $y$ dx is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (2)^2 = 2\\pi$.\n\nThird semicircle: center at x=9, radius 3.\n\nLeft endpoint at x=6, right endpoint at x=12.\n\nEquation: $y = \\sqrt{3^2 - (x - 9)^2} = \\sqrt{9 - (x - 9)^2}$.\n\nIntegral from 6 to 12 of $y$ dx is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (3)^2 = \\frac{9\\pi}{2}$.\n\nNow, if I add up these areas:\n\n$\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi + \\frac{9\\pi}{2} = \\frac{10\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi = 5\\pi + 2\\pi = 7\\pi$.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I should check if there's any overlap or if I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back at the graph, the semicircles are placed consecutively from x=0 to x=12, without overlapping. So, their areas should indeed add up directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants me to integrate each function over its respective interval and sum them up.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFor the first semicircle: $y = \\sqrt{2x - x^2}$, from x=0 to x=2.\n\nBut actually, from my earlier work, $y = \\sqrt{1 - (x - 1)^2}$.\n\nWait, but the original equation was $2x - x^2$, which I rearranged to $1 - (x - 1)^2$, so $y = \\sqrt{1 - (x - 1)^2}$.\n\nSimilarly, the second one: $-12 + 8x - x^2 = 4 - (x - 4)^2$, so $y = \\sqrt{4 - (x - 4)^2}$, from x=2 to x=6.\n\nThird one: $-72 + 18x - x^2 = 9 - (x - 9)^2$, so $y = \\sqrt{9 - (x - 9)^2}$, from x=6 to x=12.\n\nNow, integrating each of these from their respective limits should give the area under each semicircle.\n\nAlternatively, since I already know the area of each semicircle, I can just sum them up as I did before.\n\nBut perhaps to be more rigorous, I should actually compute the integrals.\n\nFirst integral: $\\int_{0}^{2} \\sqrt{1 - (x - 1)^2} dx$.\n\nLet me make a substitution: let $u = x - 1$, then when x=0, u=-1; when x=2, u=1.\n\nSo, the integral becomes $\\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{1 - u^2} du$.\n\nThis is the integral of the upper half of a circle with radius 1, which is indeed $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSecond integral: $\\int_{2}^{6} \\sqrt{4 - (x - 4)^2} dx$.\n\nLet $v = x - 4$, then when x=2, v=-2; when x=6, v=2.\n\nSo, $\\int_{-2}^{2} \\sqrt{4 - v^2} dv$, which is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\times 2^2 = 2\\pi$.\n\nThird integral: $\\int_{6}^{12} \\sqrt{9 - (x - 9)^2} dx$.\n\nLet $w = x - 9$, then when x=6, w=-3; when x=12, w=3.\n\nSo, $\\int_{-3}^{3} \\sqrt{9 - w^2} dw = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\times 3^2 = \\frac{9\\pi}{2}$.\n\nAdding them up: $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi + \\frac{9\\pi}{2} = 7\\pi$.\n\nTherefore, the total area is $7\\pi$.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider all three semicircles together, they form a larger semicircle or some combination, but from the graph, they are distinct semicircles side by side without overlapping, so their areas should just add linearly.\n\nHence, the total integral is $7\\pi$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n$$ \\boxed{7\\pi} $$"
