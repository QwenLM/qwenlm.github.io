In the scene, a gentle breeze sways the reeds, creating a play of light and shadow that reveals strong contrast. Bright areas are accented with gold leaf, glowing with warm and sacred radiance, while darker parts use deep shadows to evoke a sense of mystery and tranquility. The overall image conveys a transcendent ethereal quality, as if drawing viewers into a serene world far removed from worldly noise — a place of quiet communion between nature and the inner self."
