Here are some things you can do:\n&nbsp\n1. Take deep breaths: Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth. This can help calm your mind and body.\n2. Find a safe place: If possible, move to a safe location away from the source of the fear. If you're in a car, pull over to a parking lot or a safe spot on the side of the road.\n3. Stay informed: If you have access to information about the situation, stay informed but don't overdo it. Too much information can create more anxiety.\n4. Talk to someone: Talking to someone you trust can help you process your feelings and gain perspective. You can call a friend, family member, or even a professional counselor if needed.\n5. Practice relaxation techniques: Listening to music, doing yoga or meditation, or engaging in other relaxing activities can help reduce stress and anxiety.\n&nbsp\nRemember, it's okay to take time for yourself to process your emotions and come up with a plan that works best for you."
