            "content": "So I need to find the least odd prime factor of $ 2019^8 + 1 $. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that finding prime factors of large exponents can be tricky, but there might be some properties or theorems that can help simplify the process. Since the expression is $ 2019^8 + 1 $, maybe I can look for patterns or ways to factor this expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form $ a^n + b^n $ can sometimes be factored, especially when $ n $ is a power of 2. In this case, $ n = 8 $, which is $ 2^3 $, so that might be useful.\n\nLet me see if I can factor $ 2019^8 + 1 $. I know that $ a^4 + 1 $ can be factored as $ (a^4 + 1) = (a^2 + \\sqrt{2}a + 1)(a^2 - \\sqrt{2}a + 1) $, but that involves irrational numbers, which isn't helpful for factoring into integers. Maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write $ 2019^8 + 1 $ as $ (2019^4)^2 + 1^2 $, which resembles the sum of squares. I know that over the integers, sums of squares don't factor nicely, but maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can consider smaller exponents first and see if there's a pattern or a recurring factor that appears.\n\nLet's try computing $ 2019^2 + 1 $, $ 2019^4 + 1 $, and so on, and see if I can find any common factors or patterns.\n\nFirst, calculate $ 2019^2 + 1 $:\n\n$ 2019^2 = 2019 \\times 2019 $. I don't need the exact value right now; maybe I can just keep it as $ 2019^2 $ for now.\n\nSo, $ 2019^2 + 1 = 2019^2 + 1 $. Doesn't seem immediately helpful.\n\nNext, $ 2019^4 + 1 $. Again, it's similar to the previous expression, and I don't see an obvious factorization.\n\nMaybe I should try to see if there are any small prime numbers that divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $. Since I'm looking for the least odd prime factor, I can start testing small primes like 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on, to see if any of them divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\n\nLet's start with 3. To check if 3 divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, I can compute $ 2019^8 + 1 $ modulo 3.\n\nFirst, find $ 2019 $ modulo 3. Since $ 2019 = 3 \\times 673 $, $ 2019 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 0^8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $, and $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 0 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} $. So, 3 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\n\nNext, check 5. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 5. $ 2019 \\div 5 = 403 $ with a remainder of 4, so $ 2019 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 4^8 \\pmod{5} $. Since $ 4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{5} $, $ 4^8 \\equiv (-1)^8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} $, so 5 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\n\nNow, check 7. Find $ 2019 $ modulo 7. $ 2019 \\div 7 = 288 $ with a remainder of 3, so $ 2019 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 3^8 \\pmod{7} $. Let's compute $ 3^8 $ modulo 7.\n\nFirst, find the pattern of powers of 3 modulo 7:\n\n$ 3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} $\n\n$ 3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} $\n\n$ 3^3 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} $\n\n$ 3^4 \\equiv 18 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} $\n\n$ 3^5 \\equiv 12 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} $\n\n$ 3^6 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} $\n\nSince $ 3^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} $, then $ 3^8 = 3^{6+2} = 3^6 \\times 3^2 \\equiv 1 \\times 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 2 + 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} $, so 7 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\n\nNext, check 11. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 11. $ 2019 \\div 11 = 183 $ with a remainder of 6, so $ 2019 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 6^8 \\pmod{11} $. Let's find a pattern for powers of 6 modulo 11:\n\n$ 6^1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11} $\n\n$ 6^2 \\equiv 36 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11} $\n\n$ 6^3 \\equiv 18 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11} $\n\n$ 6^4 \\equiv 42 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11} $\n\n$ 6^5 \\equiv 54 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11} $\n\n$ 6^6 \\equiv 60 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11} $\n\n$ 6^7 \\equiv 30 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11} $\n\n$ 6^8 \\equiv 48 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11} $\n\nTherefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 4 + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11} $, so 11 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\n\nContinuing this process seems tedious. Maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps I can consider the expression $ 2019^8 + 1 $ and see if it can be expressed in a form that reveals its prime factors.\n\nI recall that for expressions like $ a^4 + 4b^4 $, there's a Sophie Germain identity: $ a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) $. Maybe I can manipulate $ 2019^8 + 1 $ into a similar form.\n\nWait, $ 2019^8 + 1 = (2019^4)^2 + 1^2 $. This resembles the sum of squares, but over integers, sums of squares don't factor nicely. Maybe I can consider complex numbers or some other algebraic identities, but that might not help in finding integer prime factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider modulo properties to find possible prime factors. For example, if $ p $ is an odd prime that divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, then $ 2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} $, which implies $ 2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} $. This means that the order of 2019 modulo $ p $ divides 16, and since $ 2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} $, the order can't divide 8. Therefore, the order must be 16.\n\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, the order of 2019 modulo $ p $ divides $ p - 1 $. Therefore, $ p - 1 $ must be divisible by 16. So, $ p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16} $.\n\nThis narrows down the possible primes $ p $ that could divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $ to those primes congruent to 1 modulo 16.\n\nLet me list some primes that are 1 modulo 16: 17, 97, 113, 193, 241, 257, etc.\n\nNow, I can test these primes to see if any of them divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\n\nStart with 17. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 17.\n\nFirst, find $ 2019 \\div 17 $. 17 times 118 is 2006, so $ 2019 - 2006 = 13 $. Therefore, $ 2019 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{17} $.\n\nThen, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 13^8 \\pmod{17} $.\n\nCompute $ 13^2 \\equiv 169 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{17} $\n\n$ 13^4 = (13^2)^2 \\equiv 16^2 \\equiv 256 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17} $\n\n$ 13^8 = (13^4)^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17} $\n\nTherefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{17} $, so 17 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\n\nNext, check 97. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 97.\n\nFirst, find how many times 97 fits into 2019. 97 times 20 is 1940, and 2019 - 1940 = 79. So, $ 2019 \\equiv 79 \\pmod{97} $.\n\nThen, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 79^8 \\pmod{97} $.\n\nThis seems a bit cumbersome to compute directly. Maybe I can find a pattern or use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that $ a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} $ if $ p $ is prime and $ p $ does not divide $ a $.\n\nHere, $ p = 97 $, so $ 79^{96} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{97} $. But I need $ 79^8 $, which is not directly helpful. Maybe I can compute $ 79^2 $, then $ 79^4 $, and so on.\n\nFirst, compute $ 79^2 \\pmod{97} $:\n\n$ 79^2 = 6241 $. Now, divide 6241 by 97.\n\n97 times 64 is 6208, so 6241 - 6208 = 33. Therefore, $ 79^2 \\equiv 33 \\pmod{97} $.\n\nNext, $ 79^4 = (79^2)^2 \\equiv 33^2 \\pmod{97} $.\n\n$ 33^2 = 1089 $. 97 times 11 is 1067, so 1089 - 1067 = 22. Therefore, $ 79^4 \\equiv 22 \\pmod{97} $.\n\nThen, $ 79^8 = (79^4)^2 \\equiv 22^2 \\pmod{97} $.\n\n$ 22^2 = 484 $. 97 times 4 is 388, so 484 - 388 = 96. Therefore, $ 79^8 \\equiv 96 \\pmod{97} $.\n\nThus, $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 96 + 1 \\equiv 97 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{97} $.\n\nSo, 97 divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $. Since 97 is the smallest prime congruent to 1 modulo 16 that we've checked and it divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, it must be the least odd prime factor of $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\n\nTherefore, the least odd prime factor is 97.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n$$ \\boxed{97} $$\n"
