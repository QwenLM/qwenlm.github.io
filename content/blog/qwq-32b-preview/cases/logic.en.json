            "content": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The equation given is:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479\n\nBut it's incorrect, and I need to add a pair of parentheses to make it true. Okay, first things first, I should understand what the current value of the left side is without any parentheses.\n\nLet's recall the order of operations: PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, multiplication comes before addition.\n\nSo, calculating step by step:\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nNow, plugging these back into the equation:\n\n1 + 6 + 20 + 42 + 72\n\nAdding these up:\n\n1 + 6 = 7\n\n7 + 20 = 27\n\n27 + 42 = 69\n\n69 + 72 = 141\n\nSo, without any parentheses, the left side equals 141, but it should be 479. That's quite a difference. So, I need to add a pair of parentheses to make it equal to 479.\n\nI need to think about where to place the parentheses to alter the order of operations to achieve the desired result.\n\nLet me consider different possibilities:\n\n1. Parenthesizing individual terms:\n\nFor example, (1 + 2) * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nCalculate inside the parentheses first:\n\n(1 + 2) = 3\n\nThen, 3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n9 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 9 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 143\n\nStill not 479.\n\n2. Parenthesizing more terms:\n\nWhat if I do (1 + 2 * 3) + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n1 + 2 * 3\n\nHere, multiplication comes before addition, so 2 * 3 = 6, then 1 + 6 = 7\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n7 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nAgain, following order of operations:\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 7 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 141\n\nSame as before.\n\n3. Let's try (1 + 2) * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n(1 + 2) = 3\n\n(3 + 4) = 7\n\nSo, 3 * 7 * 5 = 105\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n105 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 105 + 42 + 72 = 219\n\nStill not 479.\n\n4. Maybe trying to group more terms:\n\n(1 + 2 * 3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4\n\nMultiplication first: 2 * 3 = 6\n\nThen, 1 + 6 + 4 = 11\n\nSo, 11 * 5 = 55\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n55 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 55 + 42 + 72 = 169\n\nGetting closer, but still not 479.\n\n5. Let's try a different approach. Maybe grouping the additions together:\n\n1 + (2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 6 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 140\n\nThen, 1 + 140 = 141\n\nSame as before.\n\n6. Perhaps grouping two multiplications together:\n\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n(3 + 4) = 7\n\nSo, 2 * 7 * 5 = 70\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n1 + 70 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 1 + 70 + 42 + 72 = 185\n\nStill not 479.\n\n7. Maybe grouping more multiplications:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n(5 + 6) = 11\n\nSo, 4 * 11 * 7 = 308\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 308 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 1 + 6 + 308 + 72 = 387\n\nCloser, but still not 479.\n\n8. Let's try grouping the last terms:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * (7 + 8) * 9\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n(7 + 8) = 15\n\nSo, 6 * 15 * 9 = 810\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 810\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\nSo, 1 + 6 + 20 + 810 = 837\n\nNow that's way over 479.\n\nMaybe I need to group terms in a way that subtraction is implied, but since there are no subtractions in the original equation, perhaps I need to consider that.\n\nWait, maybe the problem allows for adding parentheses to change the operations indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parentheses need to group additions in a specific way.\n\nLet me try grouping the first few terms:\n\n(1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5) + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\nSo, 1 + 6 + 20 = 27\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n27 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 27 + 42 + 72 = 141\n\nSame as before.\n\n9. Maybe grouping further:\n\n(1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7) + 8 * 9\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\nSo, 1 + 6 + 20 + 42 = 69\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n69 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 69 + 72 = 141\n\nStill not 479.\n\n10. Let's try grouping differently:\n\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations inside:\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137\n\nNow, 2 * 137 = 274\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n1 + 274 = 275\n\nStill not 479.\n\n11. Maybe trying to group the additions and multiplications in a different way:\n\n1 + (2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\n\nWait, I did this earlier and got 141.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to group terms to create a larger multiplication.\n\nFor example:\n\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137\n\nNow, 2 * 137 = 274\n\nThen, 1 + 274 = 275\n\nStill not 479.\n\n12. Let's try another approach:\n\n(1 + 2) * (3 + 4) * (5 + 6) * (7 + 8) * 9\n\nWait, that's adding multiple sets of parentheses, which is not allowed since I can only add one pair.\n\nBack to the original problem: only one pair of parentheses can be added.\n\nMaybe I need to group a subtraction or division, but those operations aren't present in the original equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that adding parentheses can create a negative term, but again, there are no subtractions in the original equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parentheses are meant to group additions in a specific way to create a larger number.\n\nLet me try grouping more terms together:\n\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\n\nFirst, inside the parentheses:\n\n3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137\n\nNow, 2 * 137 = 274\n\nThen, 1 + 274 = 275\n\nSame as before.\n\n13. Maybe trying to group the last few terms:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * (7 + 8 * 9)\n\nFirst, inside the parentheses:\n\n7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nThen, 7 + 72 = 79\n\nNow, 6 * 79 = 474\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 474\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\nSo, 1 + 6 + 20 + 474 = 501\n\nClose to 479, but still not there.\n\n14. Maybe adjusting the grouping slightly:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\n\nFirst, inside the parentheses:\n\n5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 5 + 42 + 72 = 119\n\nNow, 4 * 119 = 476\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 476\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\nSo, 1 + 6 + 476 = 483\n\nStill not 479.\n\n15. Let's try grouping the first part differently:\n\n(1 + 2 * 3 + 4) * (5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\n\nFirst, calculate inside the first set of parentheses:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\nThen, 1 + 6 + 4 = 11\n\nNow, the second set of parentheses:\n\n5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 5 + 42 + 72 = 119\n\nNow, 11 * 119 = 1309\n\nWay over 479.\n\n16. Maybe trying to group only two terms:\n\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nWait, I did this earlier and got 185.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to group terms to create a division or subtraction, but since those operations aren't present, perhaps I need to consider that the parentheses can be used to create a fraction or some other operation, but that might be reaching too far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for adding a pair of parentheses around the entire equation, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the parentheses are meant to group additions in a specific way to create a larger number.\n\nLet me try grouping more terms together for multiplication.\n\nFor example:\n\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9\n\nFirst, inside the parentheses:\n\n3 + 4 * 5 + 6\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\nSo, 3 + 20 + 6 = 29\n\nNow, 2 * 29 * 7 = 406\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n1 + 406 + 8 * 9\n\nFollowing order of operations:\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 1 + 406 + 72 = 479\n\nWait a minute, that's exactly 479!\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nFirst, inside the parentheses: 3 + 4 * 5 + 6\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\nThen, 3 + 20 + 6 = 29\n\nThen, 2 * 29 * 7 = 2 * 203 = 406\n\nThen, 1 + 406 = 407\n\nPlus 8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, 407 + 72 = 479\n\nPerfect! So, by adding parentheses around (3 + 4 * 5 + 6), and multiplying that sum by 2 and 7, we get the desired result.\n\nSo, the corrected equation is:\n\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n$$ \\boxed{1 + 2 \\times (3 + 4 \\times 5 + 6) \\times 7 + 8 \\times 9 = 479} $$"
