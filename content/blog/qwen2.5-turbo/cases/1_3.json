(File: 1. DCA.pdf)\n* **MInference**: This paper proposes a method to accelerate pre-filling for long-context language models by using a dynamic sparse attention mechanism with a context memory module. (File: 2. minference.pdf)\n* **InfLLM**: This paper presents a training-free memory-based approach to enable large language models to understand extremely long sequences by incorporating an efficient context memory mechanism. (File: 4. infLLM.pdf)\n* **SnapKV**: This paper introduces a fine-tuning-free approach to efficiently minimize the key-value (KV) cache size of large language models during generation while maintaining comparable performance. (File: 7. SnapKV.pdf)\n\n**Category 2: Benchmarking Long-Context Capabilities**\n* **LV-Eval**: This paper introduces a challenging long-context benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language models across various lengths and tasks, with a focus on mitigating knowledge leakage and providing a balanced evaluation. (File: 3. lveval.pdf)\n* **NeedleBench**: This paper presents a benchmark for evaluating the retrieval and reasoning capabilities of large language models in long-context scenarios, including a needle-in-a-haystack task. (File: 5. needlebench.pdf)\n* **RULER**: This paper proposes a synthetic benchmark for evaluating long-context language models with diverse task categories, including retrieval, multi-hop tracing, aggregation, and question answering.
