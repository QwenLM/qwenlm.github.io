            "content": "To determine whether you can reach a place 110 kilometers away before 13:00, we need to analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Current Time**: It is 12:00.\n2. **Distance to Destination**: 110 kilometers.\n3. **Speed Limit for Trucks**: The speed limit sign indicates that the maximum speed for trucks is **100 km/h**.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### 1. **Calculate the Required Travel Time**\nThe formula to calculate travel time is:\n\\\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\\\]\nGiven:\n- Distance = 110 km\n- Maximum Speed = 100 km/h\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\\\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{110 \\text{ km}}{100 \\text{ km/h}} = 1.1 \\text{ hours}\n\\\\]\n\n#### 2. **Convert Time to Hours and Minutes**\n1.1 hours is equivalent to:\n\\\\[\n1 \\text{ hour} + 0.1 \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 1 \\text{ hour} + 6 \\text{ minutes} = 1 \\text{ hour and } 6 \\text{ minutes}\n\\\\]\n\n#### 3. **Determine Arrival Time**\nIf you start at 12:00 and it takes 1 hour and 6 minutes to travel 110 kilometers, your arrival time will be:\n\\\\[\n12:00 + 1 \\text{ hour and } 6 \\text{ minutes} = 13:06\n\\\\]\n\n#### 4. **Compare with Target Time**\nYou want to arrive before 13:00. However, based on the calculations, you will arrive at 13:06, which is **after** 13:00.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the speed limit of 100 km/h for trucks, it is **not possible** to reach a place 110 kilometers away before 13:00.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}\n\\\\]\n"
