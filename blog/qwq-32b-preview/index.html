Like a seeker of wisdom on an endless journey of discovery, the model demonstrates its capacity for deep introspection - questioning its own assumptions, engaging in thoughtful self-dialogue, and carefully examining each step of its reasoning process. Through these cases, you’ll observe how QwQ embodies the timeless understanding that true knowledge emerges not from hasty conclusions, but from patient inquiry and the courage to challenge one’s own certainties in the eternal pursuit of truth.\nExample: Logical Reasoning\rNext\rUser\rPlease add a pair of parentheses to the incorrect equation: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479, to make the equation true.\rQwQ-32B-Preview\rLet’s tackle this problem step by step. The equation given is:\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479\nBut it’s incorrect, and I need to add a pair of parentheses to make it true. Okay, first things first, I should understand what the current value of the left side is without any parentheses.\nLet’s recall the order of operations: PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, multiplication comes before addition.\nSo, calculating step by step:\n2 * 3 = 6\n4 * 5 = 20\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nNow, plugging these back into the equation:\n1 + 6 + 20 + 42 + 72\nAdding these up:\n1 + 6 = 7\n7 + 20 = 27\n27 + 42 = 69\n69 + 72 = 141\nSo, without any parentheses, the left side equals 141, but it should be 479. That’s quite a difference. So, I need to add a pair of parentheses to make it equal to 479.\nI need to think about where to place the parentheses to alter the order of operations to achieve the desired result.\nLet me consider different possibilities:\nParenthesizing individual terms: For example, (1 + 2) * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nCalculate inside the parentheses first:\n(1 + 2) = 3\nThen, 3 * 3 = 9\nNow, the equation becomes:\n9 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n4 * 5 = 20\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 9 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 143\nStill not 479.\nParenthesizing more terms: What if I do (1 + 2 * 3) + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n1 + 2 * 3\nHere, multiplication comes before addition, so 2 * 3 = 6, then 1 + 6 = 7\nSo, the equation becomes:\n7 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nAgain, following order of operations:\n4 * 5 = 20\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 7 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 141\nSame as before.\nLet’s try (1 + 2) * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 First, calculate inside the parentheses:\n(1 + 2) = 3\n(3 + 4) = 7\nSo, 3 * 7 * 5 = 105\nNow, the equation becomes:\n105 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 105 + 42 + 72 = 219\nStill not 479.\nMaybe trying to group more terms: (1 + 2 * 3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4\nMultiplication first: 2 * 3 = 6\nThen, 1 + 6 + 4 = 11\nSo, 11 * 5 = 55\nNow, the equation becomes:\n55 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 55 + 42 + 72 = 169\nGetting closer, but still not 479.\nLet’s try a different approach. Maybe grouping the additions together: 1 + (2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n2 * 3 = 6\n4 * 5 = 20\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 6 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 140\nThen, 1 + 140 = 141\nSame as before.\nPerhaps grouping two multiplications together: 1 + 2 * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n(3 + 4) = 7\nSo, 2 * 7 * 5 = 70\nNow, the equation becomes:\n1 + 70 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 1 + 70 + 42 + 72 = 185\nStill not 479.\nMaybe grouping more multiplications: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n(5 + 6) = 11\nSo, 4 * 11 * 7 = 308\nNow, the equation becomes:\n1 + 2 * 3 + 308 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n2 * 3 = 6\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 1 + 6 + 308 + 72 = 387\nCloser, but still not 479.\nLet’s try grouping the last terms: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * (7 + 8) * 9\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n(7 + 8) = 15\nSo, 6 * 15 * 9 = 810\nNow, the equation becomes:\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 810\nFollowing order of operations:\n2 * 3 = 6\n4 * 5 = 20\nSo, 1 + 6 + 20 + 810 = 837\nNow that’s way over 479.\nMaybe I need to group terms in a way that subtraction is implied, but since there are no subtractions in the original equation, perhaps I need to consider that.\nWait, maybe the problem allows for adding parentheses to change the operations indirectly.\nAlternatively, perhaps the parentheses need to group additions in a specific way.\nLet me try grouping the first few terms:\n(1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5) + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n2 * 3 = 6\n4 * 5 = 20\nSo, 1 + 6 + 20 = 27\nNow, the equation becomes:\n27 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 27 + 42 + 72 = 141\nSame as before.\nMaybe grouping further: (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7) + 8 * 9\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n2 * 3 = 6\n4 * 5 = 20\n6 * 7 = 42\nSo, 1 + 6 + 20 + 42 = 69\nNow, the equation becomes:\n69 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 69 + 72 = 141\nStill not 479.\nLet’s try grouping differently: 1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations inside:\n4 * 5 = 20\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137\nNow, 2 * 137 = 274\nThen, the equation becomes:\n1 + 274 = 275\nStill not 479.\nMaybe trying to group the additions and multiplications in a different way: 1 + (2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\nWait, I did this earlier and got 141.\nHmm.\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to group terms to create a larger multiplication.\nFor example:\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n4 * 5 = 20\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137\nNow, 2 * 137 = 274\nThen, 1 + 274 = 275\nStill not 479.\nLet’s try another approach: (1 + 2) * (3 + 4) * (5 + 6) * (7 + 8) * 9\nWait, that’s adding multiple sets of parentheses, which is not allowed since I can only add one pair.\nBack to the original problem: only one pair of parentheses can be added.\nMaybe I need to group a subtraction or division, but those operations aren’t present in the original equation.\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that adding parentheses can create a negative term, but again, there are no subtractions in the original equation.\nAlternatively, maybe the parentheses are meant to group additions in a specific way to create a larger number.\nLet me try grouping more terms together:\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\nFirst, inside the parentheses:\n3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n4 * 5 = 20\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137\nNow, 2 * 137 = 274\nThen, 1 + 274 = 275\nSame as before.\nMaybe trying to group the last few terms: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * (7 + 8 * 9)\nFirst, inside the parentheses:\n7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n8 * 9 = 72\nThen, 7 + 72 = 79\nNow, 6 * 79 = 474\nSo, the equation becomes:\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 474\nFollowing order of operations:\n2 * 3 = 6\n4 * 5 = 20\nSo, 1 + 6 + 20 + 474 = 501\nClose to 479, but still not there.\nMaybe adjusting the grouping slightly: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\nFirst, inside the parentheses:\n5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 5 + 42 + 72 = 119\nNow, 4 * 119 = 476\nThen, the equation becomes:\n1 + 2 * 3 + 476\nFollowing order of operations:\n2 * 3 = 6\nSo, 1 + 6 + 476 = 483\nStill not 479.\nLet’s try grouping the first part differently: (1 + 2 * 3 + 4) * (5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)\nFirst, calculate inside the first set of parentheses:\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4\nFollowing order of operations:\n2 * 3 = 6\nThen, 1 + 6 + 4 = 11\nNow, the second set of parentheses:\n5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n6 * 7 = 42\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 5 + 42 + 72 = 119\nNow, 11 * 119 = 1309\nWay over 479.\nMaybe trying to group only two terms: 1 + 2 * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9\nWait, I did this earlier and got 185.\nHmm.\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to group terms to create a division or subtraction, but since those operations aren’t present, perhaps I need to consider that the parentheses can be used to create a fraction or some other operation, but that might be reaching too far.\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for adding a pair of parentheses around the entire equation, but that doesn’t make sense.\nWait, perhaps the parentheses are meant to group additions in a specific way to create a larger number.\nLet me try grouping more terms together for multiplication.\nFor example:\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9\nFirst, inside the parentheses:\n3 + 4 * 5 + 6\nFollowing order of operations:\n4 * 5 = 20\nSo, 3 + 20 + 6 = 29\nNow, 2 * 29 * 7 = 406\nThen, the equation becomes:\n1 + 406 + 8 * 9\nFollowing order of operations:\n8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 1 + 406 + 72 = 479\nWait a minute, that’s exactly 479!\nLet me double-check:\nFirst, inside the parentheses: 3 + 4 * 5 + 6\n4 * 5 = 20\nThen, 3 + 20 + 6 = 29\nThen, 2 * 29 * 7 = 2 * 203 = 406\nThen, 1 + 406 = 407\nPlus 8 * 9 = 72\nSo, 407 + 72 = 479\nPerfect! So, by adding parentheses around (3 + 4 * 5 + 6), and multiplying that sum by 2 and 7, we get the desired result.\nSo, the corrected equation is:\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479\nFinal Answer\n$$ \\boxed{1 + 2 \\times (3 + 4 \\times 5 + 6) \\times 7 + 8 \\times 9 = 479} $$\nExample: Math\rNext\rUser\rFind the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$.\rQwQ-32B-Preview\rSo I need to find the least odd prime factor of $ 2019^8 + 1 $. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but I think I can break it down step by step.\nFirst, I know that finding prime factors of large exponents can be tricky, but there might be some properties or theorems that can help simplify the process. Since the expression is $ 2019^8 + 1 $, maybe I can look for patterns or ways to factor this expression.\nI recall that expressions of the form $ a^n + b^n $ can sometimes be factored, especially when $ n $ is a power of 2. In this case, $ n = 8 $, which is $ 2^3 $, so that might be useful.\nLet me see if I can factor $ 2019^8 + 1 $. I know that $ a^4 + 1 $ can be factored as $ (a^4 + 1) = (a^2 + \\sqrt{2}a + 1)(a^2 - \\sqrt{2}a + 1) $, but that involves irrational numbers, which isn’t helpful for factoring into integers. Maybe there’s another way.\nWait, perhaps I can write $ 2019^8 + 1 $ as $ (2019^4)^2 + 1^2 $, which resembles the sum of squares. I know that over the integers, sums of squares don’t factor nicely, but maybe there’s a different approach.\nAnother thought: maybe I can consider smaller exponents first and see if there’s a pattern or a recurring factor that appears.\nLet’s try computing $ 2019^2 + 1 $, $ 2019^4 + 1 $, and so on, and see if I can find any common factors or patterns.\nFirst, calculate $ 2019^2 + 1 $:\n$ 2019^2 = 2019 \\times 2019 $. I don’t need the exact value right now; maybe I can just keep it as $ 2019^2 $ for now.\nSo, $ 2019^2 + 1 = 2019^2 + 1 $. Doesn’t seem immediately helpful.\nNext, $ 2019^4 + 1 $. Again, it’s similar to the previous expression, and I don’t see an obvious factorization.\nMaybe I should try to see if there are any small prime numbers that divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $. Since I’m looking for the least odd prime factor, I can start testing small primes like 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on, to see if any of them divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\nLet’s start with 3. To check if 3 divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, I can compute $ 2019^8 + 1 $ modulo 3.\nFirst, find $ 2019 $ modulo 3. Since $ 2019 = 3 \\times 673 $, $ 2019 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 0^8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $, and $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 0 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} $. So, 3 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\nNext, check 5. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 5. $ 2019 \\div 5 = 403 $ with a remainder of 4, so $ 2019 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 4^8 \\pmod{5} $. Since $ 4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{5} $, $ 4^8 \\equiv (-1)^8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} $, so 5 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\nNow, check 7. Find $ 2019 $ modulo 7. $ 2019 \\div 7 = 288 $ with a remainder of 3, so $ 2019 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 3^8 \\pmod{7} $. Let’s compute $ 3^8 $ modulo 7.\nFirst, find the pattern of powers of 3 modulo 7:\n$ 3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} $\n$ 3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} $\n$ 3^3 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} $\n$ 3^4 \\equiv 18 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} $\n$ 3^5 \\equiv 12 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} $\n$ 3^6 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} $\nSince $ 3^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} $, then $ 3^8 = 3^{6+2} = 3^6 \\times 3^2 \\equiv 1 \\times 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 2 + 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} $, so 7 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\nNext, check 11. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 11. $ 2019 \\div 11 = 183 $ with a remainder of 6, so $ 2019 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 6^8 \\pmod{11} $. Let’s find a pattern for powers of 6 modulo 11:\n$ 6^1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11} $\n$ 6^2 \\equiv 36 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11} $\n$ 6^3 \\equiv 18 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11} $\n$ 6^4 \\equiv 42 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11} $\n$ 6^5 \\equiv 54 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11} $\n$ 6^6 \\equiv 60 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11} $\n$ 6^7 \\equiv 30 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11} $\n$ 6^8 \\equiv 48 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11} $\nTherefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 4 + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11} $, so 11 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\nContinuing this process seems tedious. Maybe there’s a better way to approach this problem.\nLet me think differently. Perhaps I can consider the expression $ 2019^8 + 1 $ and see if it can be expressed in a form that reveals its prime factors.\nI recall that for expressions like $ a^4 + 4b^4 $, there’s a Sophie Germain identity: $ a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) $. Maybe I can manipulate $ 2019^8 + 1 $ into a similar form.\nWait, $ 2019^8 + 1 = (2019^4)^2 + 1^2 $. This resembles the sum of squares, but over integers, sums of squares don’t factor nicely. Maybe I can consider complex numbers or some other algebraic identities, but that might not help in finding integer prime factors.\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider modulo properties to find possible prime factors. For example, if $ p $ is an odd prime that divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, then $ 2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} $, which implies $ 2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} $. This means that the order of 2019 modulo $ p $ divides 16, and since $ 2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} $, the order can’t divide 8. Therefore, the order must be 16.\nBy Fermat’s Little Theorem, the order of 2019 modulo $ p $ divides $ p - 1 $. Therefore, $ p - 1 $ must be divisible by 16. So, $ p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16} $.\nThis narrows down the possible primes $ p $ that could divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $ to those primes congruent to 1 modulo 16.\nLet me list some primes that are 1 modulo 16: 17, 97, 113, 193, 241, 257, etc.\nNow, I can test these primes to see if any of them divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\nStart with 17. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 17.\nFirst, find $ 2019 \\div 17 $. 17 times 118 is 2006, so $ 2019 - 2006 = 13 $. Therefore, $ 2019 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{17} $.\nThen, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 13^8 \\pmod{17} $.\nCompute $ 13^2 \\equiv 169 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{17} $\n$ 13^4 = (13^2)^2 \\equiv 16^2 \\equiv 256 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17} $\n$ 13^8 = (13^4)^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17} $\nTherefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{17} $, so 17 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\nNext, check 97. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 97.\nFirst, find how many times 97 fits into 2019. 97 times 20 is 1940, and 2019 - 1940 = 79. So, $ 2019 \\equiv 79 \\pmod{97} $.\nThen, $ 2019^8 \\equiv 79^8 \\pmod{97} $.\nThis seems a bit cumbersome to compute directly. Maybe I can find a pattern or use Fermat’s Little Theorem, which states that $ a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} $ if $ p $ is prime and $ p $ does not divide $ a $.\nHere, $ p = 97 $, so $ 79^{96} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{97} $. But I need $ 79^8 $, which is not directly helpful. Maybe I can compute $ 79^2 $, then $ 79^4 $, and so on.\nFirst, compute $ 79^2 \\pmod{97} $:\n$ 79^2 = 6241 $. Now, divide 6241 by 97.\n97 times 64 is 6208, so 6241 - 6208 = 33. Therefore, $ 79^2 \\equiv 33 \\pmod{97} $.\nNext, $ 79^4 = (79^2)^2 \\equiv 33^2 \\pmod{97} $.\n$ 33^2 = 1089 $. 97 times 11 is 1067, so 1089 - 1067 = 22. Therefore, $ 79^4 \\equiv 22 \\pmod{97} $.\nThen, $ 79^8 = (79^4)^2 \\equiv 22^2 \\pmod{97} $.\n$ 22^2 = 484 $. 97 times 4 is 388, so 484 - 388 = 96. Therefore, $ 79^8 \\equiv 96 \\pmod{97} $.\nThus, $ 2019^8 + 1 \\equiv 96 + 1 \\equiv 97 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{97} $.\nSo, 97 divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $. Since 97 is the smallest prime congruent to 1 modulo 16 that we’ve checked and it divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, it must be the least odd prime factor of $ 2019^8 + 1 $.\nTherefore, the least odd prime factor is 97.\nFinal Answer\n$$ \\boxed{97} $$\nReflections on the Journey Ahead The path to understanding reasoning in large language models branches into many directions, each offering unique insights into the nature of machine intelligence.

Hmm, that seems pretty big, but I think I can break it down step by step.</p><p>First, I know that finding prime factors of large exponents can be tricky, but there might be some properties or theorems that can help simplify the process. Since the expression is $ 2019^8 + 1 $, maybe I can look for patterns or ways to factor this expression.</p><p>I recall that expressions of the form $ a^n + b^n $ can sometimes be factored, especially when $ n $ is a power of 2. In this case, $ n = 8 $, which is $ 2^3 $, so that might be useful.</p><p>Let me see if I can factor $ 2019^8 + 1 $. I know that $ a^4 + 1 $ can be factored as $ (a^4 + 1) = (a^2 + \sqrt{2}a + 1)(a^2 - \sqrt{2}a + 1) $, but that involves irrational numbers, which isn&rsquo;t helpful for factoring into integers. Maybe there&rsquo;s another way.</p><p>Wait, perhaps I can write $ 2019^8 + 1 $ as $ (2019^4)^2 + 1^2 $, which resembles the sum of squares. I know that over the integers, sums of squares don&rsquo;t factor nicely, but maybe there&rsquo;s a different approach.</p><p>Another thought: maybe I can consider smaller exponents first and see if there&rsquo;s a pattern or a recurring factor that appears.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s try computing $ 2019^2 + 1 $, $ 2019^4 + 1 $, and so on, and see if I can find any common factors or patterns.</p><p>First, calculate $ 2019^2 + 1 $:</p><p>$ 2019^2 = 2019 \times 2019 $. I don&rsquo;t need the exact value right now; maybe I can just keep it as $ 2019^2 $ for now.</p><p>So, $ 2019^2 + 1 = 2019^2 + 1 $. Doesn&rsquo;t seem immediately helpful.</p><p>Next, $ 2019^4 + 1 $. Again, it&rsquo;s similar to the previous expression, and I don&rsquo;t see an obvious factorization.</p><p>Maybe I should try to see if there are any small prime numbers that divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $. Since I&rsquo;m looking for the least odd prime factor, I can start testing small primes like 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on, to see if any of them divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with 3. To check if 3 divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, I can compute $ 2019^8 + 1 $ modulo 3.</p><p>First, find $ 2019 $ modulo 3. Since $ 2019 = 3 \times 673 $, $ 2019 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 \equiv 0^8 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, and $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $. So, 3 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Next, check 5. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 5. $ 2019 \div 5 = 403 $ with a remainder of 4, so $ 2019 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \equiv 4^8 \pmod{5} $. Since $ 4 \equiv -1 \pmod{5} $, $ 4^8 \equiv (-1)^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} $, so 5 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Now, check 7. Find $ 2019 $ modulo 7. $ 2019 \div 7 = 288 $ with a remainder of 3, so $ 2019 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \equiv 3^8 \pmod{7} $. Let&rsquo;s compute $ 3^8 $ modulo 7.</p><p>First, find the pattern of powers of 3 modulo 7:</p><p>$ 3^1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} $</p><p>$ 3^2 \equiv 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} $</p><p>$ 3^3 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} $</p><p>$ 3^4 \equiv 18 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} $</p><p>$ 3^5 \equiv 12 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} $</p><p>$ 3^6 \equiv 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} $</p><p>Since $ 3^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} $, then $ 3^8 = 3^{6+2} = 3^6 \times 3^2 \equiv 1 \times 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 2 + 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} $, so 7 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Next, check 11. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 11. $ 2019 \div 11 = 183 $ with a remainder of 6, so $ 2019 \equiv 6 \pmod{11} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \equiv 6^8 \pmod{11} $. Let&rsquo;s find a pattern for powers of 6 modulo 11:</p><p>$ 6^1 \equiv 6 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^2 \equiv 36 \equiv 3 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^3 \equiv 18 \equiv 7 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^4 \equiv 42 \equiv 9 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^5 \equiv 54 \equiv 10 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^6 \equiv 60 \equiv 5 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^7 \equiv 30 \equiv 8 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^8 \equiv 48 \equiv 4 \pmod{11} $</p><p>Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 4 + 1 \equiv 5 \pmod{11} $, so 11 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Continuing this process seems tedious. Maybe there&rsquo;s a better way to approach this problem.</p><p>Let me think differently. Perhaps I can consider the expression $ 2019^8 + 1 $ and see if it can be expressed in a form that reveals its prime factors.</p><p>I recall that for expressions like $ a^4 + 4b^4 $, there&rsquo;s a Sophie Germain identity: $ a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) $. Maybe I can manipulate $ 2019^8 + 1 $ into a similar form.</p><p>Wait, $ 2019^8 + 1 = (2019^4)^2 + 1^2 $. This resembles the sum of squares, but over integers, sums of squares don&rsquo;t factor nicely. Maybe I can consider complex numbers or some other algebraic identities, but that might not help in finding integer prime factors.</p><p>Alternatively, perhaps I can consider modulo properties to find possible prime factors. For example, if $ p $ is an odd prime that divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, then $ 2019^8 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} $, which implies $ 2019^{16} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} $. This means that the order of 2019 modulo $ p $ divides 16, and since $ 2019^8 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} $, the order can&rsquo;t divide 8. Therefore, the order must be 16.</p><p>By Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem, the order of 2019 modulo $ p $ divides $ p - 1 $. Therefore, $ p - 1 $ must be divisible by 16. So, $ p \equiv 1 \pmod{16} $.</p><p>This narrows down the possible primes $ p $ that could divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $ to those primes congruent to 1 modulo 16.</p><p>Let me list some primes that are 1 modulo 16: 17, 97, 113, 193, 241, 257, etc.</p><p>Now, I can test these primes to see if any of them divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Start with 17. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 17.</p><p>First, find $ 2019 \div 17 $. 17 times 118 is 2006, so $ 2019 - 2006 = 13 $. Therefore, $ 2019 \equiv 13 \pmod{17} $.</p><p>Then, $ 2019^8 \equiv 13^8 \pmod{17} $.</p><p>Compute $ 13^2 \equiv 169 \equiv 16 \pmod{17} $</p><p>$ 13^4 = (13^2)^2 \equiv 16^2 \equiv 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{17} $</p><p>$ 13^8 = (13^4)^2 \equiv 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{17} $</p><p>Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{17} $, so 17 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Next, check 97. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 97.</p><p>First, find how many times 97 fits into 2019. 97 times 20 is 1940, and 2019 - 1940 = 79. So, $ 2019 \equiv 79 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>Then, $ 2019^8 \equiv 79^8 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>This seems a bit cumbersome to compute directly. Maybe I can find a pattern or use Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem, which states that $ a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} $ if $ p $ is prime and $ p $ does not divide $ a $.</p><p>Here, $ p = 97 $, so $ 79^{96} \equiv 1 \pmod{97} $. But I need $ 79^8 $, which is not directly helpful. Maybe I can compute $ 79^2 $, then $ 79^4 $, and so on.</p><p>First, compute $ 79^2 \pmod{97} $:</p><p>$ 79^2 = 6241 $. Now, divide 6241 by 97.</p><p>97 times 64 is 6208, so 6241 - 6208 = 33. Therefore, $ 79^2 \equiv 33 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>Next, $ 79^4 = (79^2)^2 \equiv 33^2 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>$ 33^2 = 1089 $. 97 times 11 is 1067, so 1089 - 1067 = 22. Therefore, $ 79^4 \equiv 22 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>Then, $ 79^8 = (79^4)^2 \equiv 22^2 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>$ 22^2 = 484 $. 97 times 4 is 388, so 484 - 388 = 96. Therefore, $ 79^8 \equiv 96 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>Thus, $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 96 + 1 \equiv 97 \equiv 0 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>So, 97 divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $. Since 97 is the smallest prime congruent to 1 modulo 16 that we&rsquo;ve checked and it divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, it must be the least odd prime factor of $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Therefore, the least odd prime factor is 97.</p><p><strong>Final Answer</strong></p><p>$$ \boxed{97} $$</p></div></div></div></div><h1 id=reflections-on-the-journey-ahead>Reflections on the Journey Ahead<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reflections-on-the-journey-ahead>#</a></h1><p>The path to understanding reasoning in large language models branches into many directions, each offering unique insights into the nature of machine intelligence. Our research spans multiple domains - from process reward models that shape learning patterns, to LLM critique that fosters deeper analysis, to multi-step reasoning that builds complex thought, to reinforcement learning with system feedback that enables growth through real-world interactions. While the destination remains unclear, each step brings us closer to understanding how machines think and reason. We don&rsquo;t know precisely where this journey leads, but we continue forward with unwavering determination - toward truth, toward intelligence, toward the realm where amazing happens.</p></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://qwenlm.github.io/>Qwen</a></span>
