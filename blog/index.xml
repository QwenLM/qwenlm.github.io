      <description>API Introduction We are excited to introduce the latest version of Qwen-TTS (qwen-tts-latest or qwen-tts-2025-05-22) through Qwen API . Trained on a large-scale dataset encompassing over millions of hours of speech, Qwen-TTS achieves human-level naturalness and expressiveness. Notably, Qwen-TTS automatically adjusts prosody, pacing, and emotional inflections in response to the input text. Notably, Qwen-TTS supports the generation of 3 Chinese dialects, including Pekingese, Shanghainese, and Sichuanese.
As of now, Qwen-TTS supports 7 Chinese-English bilingual voices, including Cherry, Ethan, Chelsie, Serena, Dylan (Pekingese), Jada (Shanghainese) and Sunny (Sichuanese).</description>

Introduction The evolution of multimodal large models is continually pushing the boundaries of what we believe technology can achieve. From the initial QwenVL to the latest Qwen2.5 VL, we have made progress in enhancing the model&amp;rsquo;s ability to understand image content. Today, we are excited to introduce a new model, Qwen VLo, a unified multimodal understanding and generation model. This newly upgraded model not only &amp;ldquo;understands&amp;rdquo; the world but also generates high-quality recreations based on that understanding, truly bridging the gap between perception and creation.</description>

Scaling Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enhance model performance beyond conventional pretraining and post-training methods. Recent studies have demonstrated that RL can significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of models. For instance, DeepSeek R1 has achieved state-of-the-art performance by integrating cold-start data and multi-stage training, enabling deep thinking and complex reasoning.
Our research explores the scalability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its impact on enhancing the intelligence of large language models.</description>

It is widely recognized that continuously scaling both data size and model size can lead to significant improvements in model intelligence. However, the research and industry community has limited experience in effectively scaling extremely large models, whether they are dense or Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models. Many critical details regarding this scaling process were only disclosed with the recent release of DeepSeek V3. Concurrently, we are developing Qwen2.</description>

Background The Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) architecture has become a popular model-parameter-scale-up technique. Typically, one MoE layer consists of a router (often parameterized as one single Linear layer) and a group of experts (for transformer-based models, each expert is one feedforward layer). Given an input, only a subset of experts will be activated, and then their outputs will be aggregated based on the scores the router assigned.</description>

Introduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable advances in mathematical reasoning, yet they can make mistakes, such as miscalculations or logical errors, leading to wrong conclusions. Moreover, even when achieving correct final answers, these powerful models can still regularly make up plausible reasoning steps, where the final answers build upon flawed calculations or derivations, which undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs&amp;rsquo; reasoning processes.</description>

Previously, we opensourced a series of Qwen1.5 model ranging from 0.5 to 110 billion parameters. Now, we release a larger model, Qwen-Max-0428. Qwen-Max-0428 is an instruction-tuned model for chat service. Very recently, it is available via Chatbot Arena and it has now become the top-10 in the leaderboard. Furthermore, our evaluation of MT-Bench also demonstrates that the new model outperforms our previous largest model Qwen1.5-110B-Chat.

Introduction Recently we have witnessed a burst of large-scale models with over 100 billion parameters in the opensource community. These models have demonstrated remarkable performance in both benchmark evaluation and chatbot arena. Today, we release the first 100B+ model of the Qwen1.5 series, Qwen1.5-110B, which achieves comparable performance with Meta-Llama3-70B in the base model evaluation, and outstanding performance in the chat evaluation, including MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.</description>

Introduction The advent of advanced programming tools, which harnesses the power of large language models (LLMs), has significantly enhanced programmer productivity and accuracy. Notwithstanding these advancements, dominant coding assistants like Github Copilot, built upon proprietary LLMs, pose notable challenges in terms of cost, privacy, security, and potential copyright infringement. Recognizing the imperative for a more transparent and accessible alternative, the open-source community has embarked on a concerted endeavor to develop open codeLLMs.</description>

Introduction The open-source community has long sought a model that strikes an ideal balance between performance, efficiency, and memory footprint. Despite the emergence of cutting-edge models like Qwen1.5-72B and DBRX, the models have faced persistent challenges such as large memory consumption, slow inference speed, and substantial finetuning costs.
A growing consensus within the field now points to a model with approximately 30 billion parameters as the optimal &amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;rdquo; for achieving both strong performance and manageable resource requirements.</description>

Introduction Since the surge in interest sparked by Mixtral, research on mixture-of-expert (MoE) models has gained significant momentum. Both researchers and practitioners are keenly interested in understanding how to effectively train such models and assessing their efficiency and effectiveness. Today, we introduce Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, a small MoE model with only 2.7 billion activated parameters yet matching the performance of state-of-the-art 7B models like Mistral 7B and Qwen1.</description>

Introduction In recent months, our focus has been on developing a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; model while optimizing the developer experience. As we progress towards Qwen1.5, the next iteration in our Qwen series, this update arrives just before the Chinese New Year.
With Qwen1.5, we are open-sourcing base and chat models across six sizes: 0.5B, 1.8B, 4B, 7B, 14B, 32B, 72B, and 110B, and also an MoE model (see blog for more information).</description>

      <description>Along with the rapid development of our large language model Qwen, we leveraged Qwen’s capabilities and unified multimodal pretraining to address the limitations of multimodal models in generalization, and we opensourced multimodal model Qwen-VL in Sep. 2023. Recently, the Qwen-VL series has undergone a significant upgrade with the launch of two enhanced versions, Qwen-VL-Plus and Qwen-VL-Max. The key technical advancements in these versions include:
Substantially boost in image-related reasoning capabilities; Considerable enhancement in recognizing, extracting, and analyzing details within images and texts contained therein; Support for high-definition images with resolutions above one million pixels and images of various aspect ratios.</description>

      <description>2022 is a year of generalist models! With the bloom of multimodal pretraining, especially the unified model, we have witnessed the opportunity to building a generalist model that is capable of processing tasks of different modalities or multi-modalities! Thus, we propose OFA1, namely One-For-All, a unified multimodal pretrained model that unifies understanding and generation tasks concerning modalities into a single framework, and we pretrain OFA with the instruction-based multitask-pretraining that endows it with multiple capabilities.</description>

      <description>Intro Generalist Models are hot! We all see an opportunity towards a real generalist model by multimodal multitask learning. We previously release an opensourced unified multimodal pretrained model OFA for this goal. However, we actually met a lot of difficulties in our implementation. For example, it is hard to set up multiple tasks concerning multiple modalities, and it is hard to organize multitask learning, e.g., how to batchify your data and how to make your training stable.</description>

      <description>CLIP1 is a phenomenal playmaker in vision and multimodal representation learning. It plays not only as a foundation model but also a bridge between vision and language. It has triggered a series of research in different fields, especially text-to-image generation. However, we find that there is a necessity for a language-specific CLIP for applications, especially cross-modal retrieval, and there is no opensourced Chinese CLIP with good performance. We therefore launched this project to promote the Chinese multimodal representation learning.</description>
