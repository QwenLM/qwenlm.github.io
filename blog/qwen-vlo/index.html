From the initial QwenVL to the latest Qwen2.5 VL, we have made progress in enhancing the model’s ability to understand image content. Today, we are excited to introduce a new model, Qwen VLo, a unified multimodal understanding and generation model. This newly upgraded model not only “understands” the world but also generates high-quality recreations based on that understanding, truly bridging the gap between perception and creation. Note that this is a preview version and you can access it through Qwen Chat. You can directly send a prompt like “Generate a picture of a cute cat” to generate an image or upload an image of a cat and ask “Add a cap on the cat’s head” to modify an image. The image generation process is shown below.\nThe Creative Process: Turn Your Imagination Into Reality\nAs demonstrated in the video showcasing the generative process, Qwen VLo employs a progressive generation method, gradually constructing the entire image from left to right and top to bottom. During this process, the model continuously refines and optimizes its predictions to ensure that the final result is coherent and harmonious. This generative mechanism not only enhances visual quality but also provides users with a more flexible and controllable creative experience.\nFrom Understanding to Creation: Enhanced Multimodal Generation Capabilities Qwen VLo has undergone a comprehensive upgrade in both its original multimodal understanding and generation capabilities. It significantly deepens its comprehension of image content and achieves more accurate and consistent generation results. Below are the core highlights of Qwen VLo:\nMore Precise Content Understanding and Recreation\nPrevious multimodal models often struggled with semantic inconsistencies during the generation process, such as misinterpreting a car as another object or failing to retain key structural features of the original image. Qwen VLo, equipped with enhanced detail-capturing abilities, maintains a high level of semantic consistency throughout the generation process. For instance, when a user inputs a photo of a car and requests a “color change,” Qwen VLo can accurately identify the car model, preserve its original structure, and naturally transform its color style. The generated result meets expectations while maintaining realism.\nSupport for Open-Ended Instruction-Based Editing\nUsers can provide creative instructions in natural language, such as “change this painting to a Van Gogh style,” “make this photo look like it’s from the 19th century,” or “add a sunny sky to this image.” Qwen VLo can flexibly respond to these open-ended commands and produce results that align with user expectations. Whether it’s artistic style transfer, scene reconstruction, or detailed touch-ups, the model handles them all with ease. Even traditional visual perception tasks, such as predicting depth maps, segmentation maps, detection maps, and edge information, can be accomplished through simple editing instructions. Furthermore, Qwen VLo can also seamlessly handle more complex instructions — such as modifying objects, editing text, and changing backgrounds — all within a single command.\nMultilingual Instruction Support\nQwen VLo supports multiple languages, including Chinese and English, breaking down language barriers and providing a unified, convenient interaction experience for global users. Regardless of the language you use, simply describe your needs, and the model will quickly understand and deliver the desired output.\nDemo Cases Qwen VLo acts like a human artist, using its understanding to turn imagination into reality. Below are some examples for reference.\nQwen VLo is capable of directly generating images and modifying them by replacing backgrounds, adding subjects, performing style transfers, and even executing extensive modifications based on open-ended instructions, as well as handling detection and segmentation tasks.\nA cute Shiba Inu\rNext\rUser\r生成一个可爱的柴犬\nTranslation: Generate a cute Shiba Inu\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r背景改成草原\nTranslation: Change the background to a grassland\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r给它带上红色帽子和黑色透明墨镜,帽子上写着“QwenVLo”\nTranslation: Put a red hat and black transparent sunglasses on it, with ‘QwenVLo’ written on the hat\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r变成吉卜力风格\nTranslation: Switch to Ghibli style\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r变成3d Q版风格\nTranslation: Switch to 3D Q-version style\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r把它放到水晶球里\nTranslation: Place it inside a crystal ball\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r桌面上摆着这个水晶球，生成以一个人的第一视角在公园的圆形咖啡桌上在笔记本上画画\nTranslation: Place this crystal ball on a desk and generate an image from a first-person perspective of someone drawing on a notebook placed on a round coffee table in a park\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r用蓝色的蒙版检测框框出图中的笔\nTranslation: Use a blue mask to detect and frame the pen in the picture\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r用粉色的mask分割出图中的狗狗边缘\nTranslation: Use a pink mask to segment the edge of the dog in the picture\nQwen-VLo\rQwen VLo can reinterpret and recreate based on its understanding, allowing for greater flexibility in style changes and migrations, such as transforming cartoons into realistic images or turning figures into balloons, among other creative outputs.\nStyle Conversion\rNext\rUser\r变成真实照片\nTranslation: Turn into a real photo\rQwen-VLo\rUser\r背景换成艾弗尔铁塔\nTranslation: Change the background to the Eiffel Tower\rQwen-VLo\rUser\r变成气球飘到空中\nTranslation: Turn into a balloon floating in the air\rQwen-VLo\rUser\r把西瓜换成榴莲\nTranslation: Replace the watermelon with durian\rQwen-VLo\rStyle Conversion\rNext\rUser\rConvert the couple in the photo into a minimalist flat illustration style Q-version sticker, retaining the facial features, with thick white borders, figures extending beyond the circular area, the circular area filled with a solid color, transparent background, and an overall cute style.\rQwen-VLo\rUser\rConvert the couple in the photo into a detailed, exquisite, and adorable 3D rendered collectible figurine, placed inside a cozy and romantic display box decorated with light cream and soft golden accents, while preserving the characteristics of the snowy scene and the figures’ poses.\rQwen-VLo\rUser\rAdd the text “Happy Wedding”\rQwen-VLo\rStyle Conversion\rNext\rUser\r变成吉卜力风格\nTranslation: Turn into Ghibli style\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r变成海贼王画风\nTranslation: Turn into One Piece art style\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r变成龙珠画风\nTranslation: Turn into Dragon Ball art style\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r变成海绵宝宝风格\nTranslation: Turn into SpongeBob style\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r变成我的世界里的角色\nTranslation: Turn into a character from Minecraft\nQwen-VLo\rUser\r变成像素画风格\nTranslation: Turn into pixel art style\nQwen-VLo\rStyle Conversion\rNext\rUser\r将照片中的猫转换为皮克斯 3D 风格，保持蓝眼睛和白橙色毛发特征，背景为红色树叶的秋日氛围。\nTranslation: Transform the cat in the photo into Pixar 3D style, maintaining the features of blue eyes and white-orange fur, with the autumn atmosphere of red leaves in the background.\nQwen-VLo\rStyle Conversion\rNext\rUser\r将迈阿密夜景的繁华城市天际线转换为果冻质感（布丁造型）的特殊材质建模风格，主题为现代都市，添加透明果冻层叠加的效果和微妙的弹性物理模拟。\nTranslation: Transform the bustling city skyline of Miami’s night view into a special material modeling style with a jelly-like texture (pudding shape), with the theme of modern city.

Expressive eyes and a friendly demeanor. Cat: The kitten appears to be a Tabby cat. Key characteristics include: Striped or spotted fur pattern, which is typical of tabby cats. A mix of brown, black, and white fur, which is common in tabby patterns. Both animals are young and appear to be very playful and curious, which is typical behavior for puppies and kittens. The interaction between them suggests a friendly and affectionate relationship, which is often seen when different species bond early in life.\nHow to Use Qwen VLo uses dynamic resolution training, supporting dynamic resolution generation. Both input and output allow for images of arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. This means users are no longer constrained by fixed formats and can generate images tailored to different scenarios, whether it’s posters, illustrations, web banners, or social media covers.\nAdditionally, Qwen VLo introduces an innovative generative mechanism: a progressive top-to-bottom, left-to-right generation process.\nThis mechanism not only improves generation efficiency but is particularly suited for tasks requiring fine control, such as generating long paragraphs of text. For example, when designing advertisements or comic panels with extensive text, Qwen VLo generates content progressively, allowing users to observe and adjust the process in real-time for optimal creative results.\nLimitations Qwen VLo is still in the preview stage, and there are many shortcomings. During the generation process, there may be issues such as inaccuracies, inconsistencies with the original image, non-compliance with instructions, and instability in recognizing and understanding the intent of the generated images. We appreciate your understanding. We will continue to iterate and improve the stability and robustness of the model.\nNext Steps: Express Ideas Through Images, Foster Understanding Through Generation As multimodal large models increasingly gain the ability to handle bidirectional text and visual inputs and outputs, we are opening up new avenues for expression and interaction. In the future, models will not only answer questions with text but also convey ideas and meanings through images. For example, generating diagrams, adding auxiliary lines, or annotating key areas will provide users with more diverse communication tools.\nMoreover, multimodal models with generative capabilities offer new ways to supervise and refine their understanding. By generating intermediate results like segmentation maps or detection maps, the model can verify its own comprehension and further improve its performance. This is a direction we will continue to explore and develop in the future.\n","wordCount":"3250","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-06-26T22:00:04+08:00","dateModified":"2025-06-26T22:00:04+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Qwen Team"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen-vlo/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Qwen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://qwenlm.github.io/favicon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>const hasHeaderBg=!1</script><header class=header><div class=nav-container><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/ accesskey=h title="Qwen (Alt + H)"><img src=https://qwenlm.github.io/img/logo.png alt aria-label=logo height=30></a></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=/publication title=Publication><span>Publication</span></a></li><li><a href=/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://chat.qwen.ai title="Try Qwen Chat"><span>Try Qwen Chat</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></div></header><div class=hero-container><div class=hero><h1 class=post-title>Qwen VLo: From "Understanding" the World to "Depicting" It</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-06-26 22:00:04 +0800 +0800'>June 26, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3250 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Qwen Team&nbsp;|&nbsp;Translations:<ul class=i18n_list><li><a href=https://qwenlm.github.io/zh/blog/qwen-vlo/>简体中文</a></li></ul></div></div></div><main class=main><article class=post-single><div class=post-content><p><a href=https://chat.qwenlm.ai class="btn external" target=_blank>QWEN CHAT</a>
<a href=https://discord.gg/yPEP2vHTu4 class="btn external" target=_blank>DISCORD</a></p><h2 id=introduction><strong>Introduction</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>The evolution of multimodal large models is continually pushing the boundaries of what we believe technology can achieve. From the initial QwenVL to the latest Qwen2.5 VL, we have made progress in enhancing the model&rsquo;s ability to understand image content. Today, we are excited to introduce a new model, Qwen VLo, a unified multimodal understanding and generation model. This newly upgraded model not only &ldquo;understands&rdquo; the world but also generates high-quality recreations based on that understanding, truly bridging the gap between perception and creation. Note that this is a preview version and you can access it through Qwen Chat. You can directly send a prompt like &ldquo;Generate a picture of a cute cat&rdquo; to generate an image or upload an image of a cat and ask &ldquo;Add a cap on the cat&rsquo;s head&rdquo; to modify an image. The image generation process is shown below.</p><p><strong>The Creative Process: Turn Your Imagination Into Reality</strong></p><figure><video loop src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-VLo/head_en.mov autoplay></video></figure><p>As demonstrated in the video showcasing the generative process, Qwen VLo employs a progressive generation method, gradually constructing the entire image from left to right and top to bottom. During this process, the model continuously refines and optimizes its predictions to ensure that the final result is coherent and harmonious. This generative mechanism not only enhances visual quality but also provides users with a more flexible and controllable creative experience.</p><hr><h2 id=from-understanding-to-creation-enhanced-multimodal-generation-capabilities><strong>From Understanding to Creation: Enhanced Multimodal Generation Capabilities</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#from-understanding-to-creation-enhanced-multimodal-generation-capabilities>#</a></h2><p>Qwen VLo has undergone a comprehensive upgrade in both its original multimodal understanding and generation capabilities. It significantly deepens its comprehension of image content and achieves more accurate and consistent generation results. Below are the core highlights of Qwen VLo:</p><ol><li><p><strong>More Precise Content Understanding and Recreation</strong></p><p>Previous multimodal models often struggled with semantic inconsistencies during the generation process, such as misinterpreting a car as another object or failing to retain key structural features of the original image. Qwen VLo, equipped with enhanced detail-capturing abilities, maintains a high level of semantic consistency throughout the generation process. For instance, when a user inputs a photo of a car and requests a &ldquo;color change,&rdquo; Qwen VLo can accurately identify the car model, preserve its original structure, and naturally transform its color style. The generated result meets expectations while maintaining realism.</p></li><li><p><strong>Support for Open-Ended Instruction-Based Editing</strong></p><p>Users can provide creative instructions in natural language, such as &ldquo;change this painting to a Van Gogh style,&rdquo; &ldquo;make this photo look like it’s from the 19th century,&rdquo; or &ldquo;add a sunny sky to this image.&rdquo; Qwen VLo can flexibly respond to these open-ended commands and produce results that align with user expectations. Whether it’s artistic style transfer, scene reconstruction, or detailed touch-ups, the model handles them all with ease. Even traditional visual perception tasks, such as predicting depth maps, segmentation maps, detection maps, and edge information, can be accomplished through simple editing instructions. Furthermore, Qwen VLo can also seamlessly handle more complex instructions — such as modifying objects, editing text, and changing backgrounds — all within a single command.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multilingual Instruction Support</strong></p><p>Qwen VLo supports multiple languages, including Chinese and English, breaking down language barriers and providing a unified, convenient interaction experience for global users. Regardless of the language you use, simply describe your needs, and the model will quickly understand and deliver the desired output.</p></li></ol><hr><h2 id=demo-cases><strong>Demo Cases</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#demo-cases>#</a></h2><p>Qwen VLo acts like a human artist, using its understanding to turn imagination into reality. Below are some examples for reference.</p><p>Qwen VLo is capable of directly generating images and modifying them by replacing backgrounds, adding subjects, performing style transfers, and even executing extensive modifications based on open-ended instructions, as well as handling detection and segmentation tasks.</p><div class="full-width-container example-container"><div class=example-content><div class=title><span>A cute Shiba Inu</span>

Both input and output allow for images of arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. This means users are no longer constrained by fixed formats and can generate images tailored to different scenarios, whether it’s posters, illustrations, web banners, or social media covers.</p><p>Additionally, Qwen VLo introduces an innovative generative mechanism: a progressive top-to-bottom, left-to-right generation process.</p><p>This mechanism not only improves generation efficiency but is particularly suited for tasks requiring fine control, such as generating long paragraphs of text. For example, when designing advertisements or comic panels with extensive text, Qwen VLo generates content progressively, allowing users to observe and adjust the process in real-time for optimal creative results.</p><h2 id=limitations><strong>Limitations</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#limitations>#</a></h2><p>Qwen VLo is still in the preview stage, and there are many shortcomings. During the generation process, there may be issues such as inaccuracies, inconsistencies with the original image, non-compliance with instructions, and instability in recognizing and understanding the intent of the generated images. We appreciate your understanding. We will continue to iterate and improve the stability and robustness of the model.</p><hr><h2 id=next-steps-express-ideas-through-images-foster-understanding-through-generation><strong>Next Steps: Express Ideas Through Images, Foster Understanding Through Generation</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#next-steps-express-ideas-through-images-foster-understanding-through-generation>#</a></h2><p>As multimodal large models increasingly gain the ability to handle bidirectional text and visual inputs and outputs, we are opening up new avenues for expression and interaction. In the future, models will not only answer questions with text but also convey ideas and meanings through images. For example, generating diagrams, adding auxiliary lines, or annotating key areas will provide users with more diverse communication tools.</p><p>Moreover, multimodal models with generative capabilities offer new ways to supervise and refine their understanding. By generating intermediate results like segmentation maps or detection maps, the model can verify its own comprehension and further improve its performance. This is a direction we will continue to explore and develop in the future.</p></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://qwenlm.github.io/>Qwen</a></span>
