This time, we bring to you:\nPretrained and instruction-tuned models of 5 sizes, including Qwen2-0.5B, Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2-7B, Qwen2-57B-A14B, and Qwen2-72B; Having been trained on data in 27 additional languages besides English and Chinese; State-of-the-art performance in a large number of benchmark evaluations; Significantly improved performance in coding and mathematics; Extended context length support up to 128K tokens with Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Qwen2-72B-Instruct. We have opensourced the models in Hugging Face and ModelScope to you and we are looking forward to hearing from you!\nModel Information The Qwen2 series include base and instruction-tuned models of 5 sizes, including Qwen2-0.5B, Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2-7B, Qwen2-57B-A14B, Qwen2-72B. We illustrate the key information of the models in the following table:\nModels Qwen2-0.5B Qwen2-1.5B Qwen2-7B Qwen2-57B-A14B Qwen2-72B # Params 0.49B 1.54B 7.07B 57.41B 72.71B # Non-Emb Params 0.35B 1.31B 5.98B 56.32B 70.21B GQA True True True True True Tie Embedding True True False False False Context Length 32K 32K 128K 64K 128K Specifically, previously in Qwen1.5, only Qwen1.5-32B and Qwen1.5-110B have adopted Group Query Attention (GQA). This time, for all model sizes, we apply GQA so that they can enjoy the benefits of faster speed and less memory usage in model inference. For small models, we prefer the application of tying embedding as the large sparse embeddings take up a large proportion of the total model parameters.\nIn terms of the context length, all base language models have been pretrained on data of the context length of 32K tokens, and we observe satisfactory extrapolation capabilities up to 128K in PPL evaluation. However, for instruction-tuned models, we are not satisfied with merely PPL evaluation; we need the models to be capable of correctly understanding long context and completing tasks. In the table, we list the context length capabilities of instruction-tuned models, as assessed through the evaluation of the Needle in a Haystack task. Notably, when augmented with YARN, both Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Qwen2-72B-Instruct models demonstrate an impressive capacity to handle context lengths extending up to 128K tokens.\nSignificant efforts were directed towards augmenting both the volume and quality of pretraining and instruction-tuning datasets across a diverse linguistic spectrum, beyond English and Chinese, to bolster its multilingual competencies. Although large language models possess an inherent capacity to generalize to other languages, we explicitly highlight the inclusion of 27 additional languages in our training:\nRegions Languages Western Europe German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch Eastern \u0026 Central Europe Russian, Czech, Polish Middle East Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Turkish Eastern Asia Japanese, Korean South-Eastern Asia Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Malay, Lao, Burmese, Cebuano, Khmer, Tagalog Southern Asia Hindi, Bengali, Urdu Additionally, we have devoted significant effort to addressing code-switching, a frequent occurrence in multilingual evaluation. Consequently, our models’ proficiency in handling this phenomenon have notably enhanced. Evaluations using prompts that typically induce code-switching across languages confirm a substantial reduction in associated issues.\nPerformance Comparative assessments reveal substantial enhancements in performance for large-scale models (70B+ parameters) relative to Qwen1.5. Here our evaluation centers on the large-size model Qwen2-72B. In terms of base language models, Qwen2-72B and state-of-the-art open models are evaluated for different capbilities including natural language understanding, knowledge acquisition, coding proficiency, mathematical skills, and multilingual abilities. Benefiting from meticulously curated datasets and optimized training methods, Qwen2-72B exhibits superior performance compared to leading models such as Llama-3-70B. Notably, it surpasses the performance of its predecessor, Qwen1.5-110B, despite having fewer parameters.\nAfter extensive large-scale pre-training, we conduct post-training to further enhance Qwen’s intelligence, bringing it closer to human. This process further improves the model’s capabilities in areas such as coding, mathematics, reasoning, instruction following, multilingual understanding, and more. Additionally, it aligns the model’s output with human values, ensuring that it is helpful, honest, and harmless. Our post-training phase is designed with the principle of scalable training with minimal human annotation. Specifically, we investigate how to obtain high-quality, reliable, diverse and creative demonstration data and preference data with various automated alignment strategies, such as rejection sampling for math, execution feedback for coding and instruction-following, back-translation for creative writing, scalable oversight for role-play, etc. As for training, we apply a combination of supervised fine-tuning, reward model training and online DPO training. We also employ a novel Online Merging Optimizer to minimize the alignment tax. These collective efforts have significantly boosted the capabilities and intelligence of our models, as illustrated in the following table.\nWe comprehensively evaluate Qwen2-72B-Instruct on 16 benchmarks across various domains. Qwen2-72B-Instruct strikes a balance between obtaining better capabilities and aligning well with human values. Specifically, Qwen2-72B-Instruct significantly surpasses Qwen1.5-72B-Chat across all benchmarks, and also reaches competitive performance compared with Llama-3-70B-Instruct.1\nIn terms of smaller models, our Qwen2 models also outcompete the SOTA models of similar or even larger sizes. In comparison with the very recently released SOTA models, Qwen2-7B-Instruct can still demonstrate advantages across benchmarks, showing specifically outstanding performance on coding and Chinese-related metrics.1\nHighlights Coding \u0026 Mathematics We have persistently dedicated our efforts to enhance the advanced capabilities of Qwen, particularly in coding and mathematics. In coding, we have successfully integrated the code training experience and data from CodeQwen1.5, resulting in significant improvements in Qwen2-72B-Instruct across various programming languages. Regarding mathematics, by exploiting the extensive and high-quality datasets, Qwen2-72B-Instruct has reflects stronger capabilities in solving mathematic problems.\nLong Context Understanding In Qwen2, all instruction-tuned models have been trained on 32k length contexts, and extrapolated to longer context lengths using techniques like YARN or Dual Chunk Attention.\nThe figure below shows our test results on the Needle in a Haystack. Notably, Qwen2-72B-Instruct is capable of flawlessly handling information extraction tasks within a 128k context. Coupled with its inherent strong performance, it becomes the preferred choice for handling long text tasks when resources are sufficient.\nAdditionally, it’s worth noting the impressive capabilities of other models in the series: Qwen2-7B-Instruct nearly flawlessly handles contexts up to 128k in length, Qwen2-57B-A14B-Instruct manages contexts up to 64k, and the two smaller models in the lineup support contexts of 32k.\nAlongside the long-context models, we have also open-sourced an agent solution for efficiently processing documents containing up to 1 million tokens. For more details, see our dedicated blog post on this topic.\nSafety and Responsibility The table below presents the proportion of harmful responses generated by large models for four categories of multilingual unsafe querys(Illegal Activity, Fraud, Pornography, Privacy Violence). The test data was derived from Jailbreak and translated into multiple languages for evaluation. We find that Llama-3 does not effectively handle multilingual prompts, and therefore, it is not included in the comparison. Through significance testing (P_value), we found that the Qwen2-72B-Instruct model performs comparably to GPT-4 in terms of safety, and significantly outperforms the Mistral-8x22B model.\nLanguage Illegal Activity Fraud Pornography Privacy Violence GPT-4 Mistral-8x22B Qwen2-72B-Instruct GPT-4 Mistral-8x22B Qwen2-72B-Instruct GPT-4 Mistral-8x22B Qwen2-72B-Instruct GPT-4 Mistral-8x22B Qwen2-72B-Instruct zh 0% 13% 0% 0% 17% 0% 43% 47% 53% 0% 10% 0% en 0% 7% 0% 0% 23% 0% 37% 67% 63% 0% 27% 3% ar 0% 13% 0% 0% 7% 0% 15% 26% 15% 3% 13% 0% es 0% 7% 0% 3% 0% 0% 48% 64% 50% 3% 7% 3% fr 0% 3% 0% 3% 3% 7% 3% 19% 7% 0% 27% 0% ko 0% 4% 0% 3% 8% 4% 17% 29% 10% 0% 26% 4% pt 0% 7% 0% 3% 7% 3% 47% 57% 47% 4% 26% 4% th 0% 10% 0% 7% 23% 3% 13% 17% 10% 13% 7% 7% vi 0% 4% 0% 4% 11% 0% 22% 26% 22% 0% 0% 0% Average 0% 8% 0% 3% 11% 2% 27% 39% 31% 3% 16% 2% Developing with Qwen2 Now all models have been released in Hugging Face and ModelScope. Feel free to visit the model cards for detailed usages, and learn more information about each model, including its features, performance, etc.\nFor a long time, a lot of friends have been supporting the development of Qwen, including finetuning (Axolotl, Llama-Factory, Firefly, Swift, XTuner), quantization (AutoGPTQ, AutoAWQ, Neural Compressor), deployment (vLLM, SGL, SkyPilot, TensorRT-LLM, OpenVino, TGI), API platforms (Together, Fireworks, OpenRouter), local run (MLX, Llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio), Agent and RAG Frameworks (LlamaIndex, CrewAI, OpenDevin) , Evaluation (LMSys, OpenCompass, Open LLM Leaderboard), model training (Dolphin, Openbuddy) etc. For how to use Qwen2 with the third-party frameworks, please refer to the respective documentation as well as our official documentation.\nStill there are a number of teams and people not mentioned that have made contributions to Qwen. We sincerely thank them for the support, and we hope that our collaboration can boost the research and development of the opensource AI community.\nLicense This time, we change the licenses of our models to different ones. While Qwen2-72B as well as its instruction-tuned models still uses the original Qianwen License, all other models, including Qwen2-0.5B, Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2-7B, and Qwen2-57B-A14B, turn to adopt Apache 2.0! We believe that the enhanced openness of our models to the community can accelerate the applications and commercial usages of Qwen2 all around the world.\nWhat’s Next for Qwen2? We are training larger Qwen2 models to further explore model scaling along with our recent data scaling. Additionally, we extend the Qwen2 language models to multimodal, capable of understanding both vision and audio information. In the near future, we will continue opensource new models to accelerate opensource AI.

We illustrate the key information of the models in the following table:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Models</th><th style=text-align:center>Qwen2-0.5B</th><th style=text-align:center>Qwen2-1.5B</th><th style=text-align:center>Qwen2-7B</th><th style=text-align:center>Qwen2-57B-A14B</th><th style=text-align:center>Qwen2-72B</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left># Params</td><td style=text-align:center>0.49B</td><td style=text-align:center>1.54B</td><td style=text-align:center>7.07B</td><td style=text-align:center>57.41B</td><td style=text-align:center>72.71B</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left># Non-Emb Params</td><td style=text-align:center>0.35B</td><td style=text-align:center>1.31B</td><td style=text-align:center>5.98B</td><td style=text-align:center>56.32B</td><td style=text-align:center>70.21B</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>GQA</td><td style=text-align:center>True</td><td style=text-align:center>True</td><td style=text-align:center>True</td><td style=text-align:center>True</td><td style=text-align:center>True</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Tie Embedding</td><td style=text-align:center>True</td><td style=text-align:center>True</td><td style=text-align:center>False</td><td style=text-align:center>False</td><td style=text-align:center>False</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Context Length</td><td style=text-align:center>32K</td><td style=text-align:center>32K</td><td style=text-align:center>128K</td><td style=text-align:center>64K</td><td style=text-align:center>128K</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Specifically, previously in Qwen1.5, only Qwen1.5-32B and Qwen1.5-110B have adopted Group Query Attention (GQA). This time, for all model sizes, we apply GQA so that they can enjoy the benefits of faster speed and less memory usage in model inference. For small models, we prefer the application of tying embedding as the large sparse embeddings take up a large proportion of the total model parameters.</p><p>In terms of the context length, all base language models have been pretrained on data of the context length of 32K tokens, and we observe satisfactory extrapolation capabilities up to 128K in PPL evaluation.
However, for instruction-tuned models, we are not satisfied with merely PPL evaluation; we need the models to be capable of correctly understanding long context and completing tasks.
In the table, we list the context length capabilities of instruction-tuned models, as assessed through the evaluation of the <a href=https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack>Needle in a Haystack</a> task. Notably, when augmented with YARN, both Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Qwen2-72B-Instruct models demonstrate an impressive capacity to handle context lengths extending up to 128K tokens.</p><p>Significant efforts were directed towards augmenting both the volume and quality of pretraining and instruction-tuning datasets across a diverse linguistic spectrum, beyond English and Chinese, to bolster its multilingual competencies. Although large language models possess an inherent capacity to generalize to other languages, we explicitly highlight the inclusion of 27 additional languages in our training:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Regions</th><th style=text-align:center>Languages</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>Western Europe</td><td style=text-align:center>German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Eastern & Central Europe</td><td style=text-align:center>Russian, Czech, Polish</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Middle East</td><td style=text-align:center>Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Turkish</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Eastern Asia</td><td style=text-align:center>Japanese, Korean</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>South-Eastern Asia</td><td style=text-align:center>Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Malay, Lao, Burmese, Cebuano, Khmer, Tagalog</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Southern Asia</td><td style=text-align:center>Hindi, Bengali, Urdu</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Additionally, we have devoted significant effort to addressing code-switching, a frequent occurrence in multilingual evaluation. Consequently, our models&rsquo; proficiency in handling this phenomenon have notably enhanced. Evaluations using prompts that typically induce code-switching across languages confirm a substantial reduction in associated issues.</p><h1 id=performance>Performance<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#performance>#</a></h1><p>Comparative assessments reveal substantial enhancements in performance for large-scale models (70B+ parameters) relative to Qwen1.5. Here our evaluation centers on the large-size model Qwen2-72B.
In terms of base language models, Qwen2-72B and state-of-the-art open models are evaluated for different capbilities including natural language understanding, knowledge acquisition, coding proficiency, mathematical skills, and multilingual abilities.
Benefiting from meticulously curated datasets and optimized training methods, Qwen2-72B exhibits superior performance compared to leading models such as Llama-3-70B. Notably, it surpasses the performance of its predecessor, Qwen1.5-110B, despite having fewer parameters.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2/qwen2-72b.jpg#center width=100%></figure><p>After extensive large-scale pre-training, we conduct post-training to further enhance Qwen&rsquo;s intelligence, bringing it closer to human. This process further improves the model&rsquo;s capabilities in areas such as coding, mathematics, reasoning, instruction following, multilingual understanding, and more. Additionally, it aligns the model&rsquo;s output with human values, ensuring that it is helpful, honest, and harmless. Our post-training phase is designed with the principle of scalable training with minimal human annotation. Specifically, we investigate how to obtain high-quality, reliable, diverse and creative demonstration data and preference data with various automated alignment strategies, such as <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01825>rejection sampling</a> for math, execution feedback for coding and instruction-following, back-translation for creative writing, <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12474>scalable oversight</a> for role-play, etc. As for training, we apply a combination of supervised fine-tuning, reward model training and online DPO training. We also employ a novel <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17931>Online Merging Optimizer</a> to minimize the alignment tax. These collective efforts have significantly boosted the capabilities and intelligence of our models, as illustrated in the following table.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2/qwen2-72b-instruct.jpg#center width=100%></figure><p>We comprehensively evaluate Qwen2-72B-Instruct on 16 benchmarks across various domains. Qwen2-72B-Instruct strikes a balance between obtaining better capabilities and aligning well with human values. Specifically, Qwen2-72B-Instruct significantly surpasses Qwen1.5-72B-Chat across all benchmarks, and also reaches competitive performance compared with Llama-3-70B-Instruct.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>In terms of smaller models, our Qwen2 models also outcompete the SOTA models of similar or even larger sizes. In comparison with the very recently released SOTA models, Qwen2-7B-Instruct can still demonstrate advantages across benchmarks, showing specifically outstanding performance on coding and Chinese-related metrics.<sup id=fnref1:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2/qwen2-7b.jpg#center width=100%></figure><h1 id=highlights>Highlights<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#highlights>#</a></h1><h2 id=coding--mathematics>Coding & Mathematics<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#coding--mathematics>#</a></h2><p>We have persistently dedicated our efforts to enhance the advanced capabilities of Qwen, particularly in coding and mathematics. In coding, we have successfully integrated the code training experience and data from <a href=https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/codeqwen1.5/>CodeQwen1.5</a>, resulting in significant improvements in Qwen2-72B-Instruct across various programming languages. Regarding mathematics, by exploiting the extensive and high-quality datasets, Qwen2-72B-Instruct has reflects stronger capabilities in solving mathematic problems.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2/qwen2-code-math.jpg#center width=100%></figure><h2 id=long-context-understanding>Long Context Understanding<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#long-context-understanding>#</a></h2><p>In Qwen2, all instruction-tuned models have been trained on 32k length contexts, and extrapolated to longer context lengths using techniques like <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071>YARN</a> or <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17463>Dual Chunk Attention</a>.</p><p>The figure below shows our test results on the <a href=https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack>Needle in a Haystack</a>. Notably, Qwen2-72B-Instruct is capable of flawlessly handling information extraction tasks within a 128k context. Coupled with its inherent strong performance, it becomes the preferred choice for handling long text tasks when resources are sufficient.</p><p>Additionally, it&rsquo;s worth noting the impressive capabilities of other models in the series: Qwen2-7B-Instruct nearly flawlessly handles contexts up to 128k in length, Qwen2-57B-A14B-Instruct manages contexts up to 64k, and the two smaller models in the lineup support contexts of 32k.</p><p>Alongside the long-context models, we have also open-sourced an agent solution for efficiently processing documents containing up to 1 million tokens. For more details, see <a href=https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen-agent-2405/>our dedicated blog post on this topic</a>.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2/qwen2_needle_in_haystack.png#center width=100%></figure><h2 id=safety-and-responsibility>Safety and Responsibility<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#safety-and-responsibility>#</a></h2><p>The table below presents the proportion of harmful responses generated by large models for four categories of multilingual unsafe querys(Illegal Activity, Fraud, Pornography, Privacy Violence). The test data was derived from <a href=https://github.com/verazuo/jailbreak_llms/tree/main>Jailbreak</a> and translated into multiple languages for evaluation. We find that Llama-3 does not effectively handle multilingual prompts, and therefore, it is not included in the comparison. Through significance testing (P_value), we found that the Qwen2-72B-Instruct model performs comparably to GPT-4 in terms of safety, and significantly outperforms the Mistral-8x22B
